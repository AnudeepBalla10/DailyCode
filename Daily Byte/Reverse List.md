# Reverse List

ðŸ“–This question is asked by Facebook.ðŸ“– 

> Given a linked list, containing unique values, reverse it, and return the result.

Ex: Given the following linked lists...

- 1->2->3->null, return a reference to the node that contains 3 which points to a list that looks like the following: 3->2->1->null
- 7->15->9->2->null, return a reference to the node that contains 2 which points to a list that looks like the following: 2->9->15->7->null
- 1->null, return a reference to the node that contains 1 which points to a list that looks like the following: 1->null

```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
  public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
    ListNode prev = null;

    while (head != null) {
      ListNode next = head.next;
      head.next = prev;
      prev = head;
      head = next;
    }

    return prev;
  }
}
  ```
